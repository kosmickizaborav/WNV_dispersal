  abstract = {Flight speed is expected to increase with mass and wing loading among flying animals and aircraft for fundamental aerodynamic reasons. Assuming geometrical and dynamical similarity, cruising flight speed is predicted to vary as (body mass)1/6 and (wing loading)1/2 among bird species. To test these scaling rules and the general importance of mass and wing loading for bird flight speeds, we used tracking radar to measure flapping flight speeds of individuals or flocks of migrating birds visually identified to species as well as their altitude and winds at the altitudes where the birds were flying. Equivalent airspeeds (airspeeds corrected to sea level air density, Ue) of 138 species, ranging 0.01–10 kg in mass, were analysed in relation to biometry and phylogeny. Scaling exponents in relation to mass and wing loading were significantly smaller than predicted (about 0.12 and 0.32, respectively, with similar results for analyses based on species and independent phylogenetic contrasts). These low scaling exponents may be the result of evolutionary restrictions on bird flight-speed range, counteracting too slow flight speeds among species with low wing loading and too fast speeds among species with high wing loading. This compression of speed range is partly attained through geometric differences, with aspect ratio showing a positive relationship with body mass and wing loading, but additional factors are required to fully explain the small scaling exponent of Ue in relation to wing loading. Furthermore, mass and wing loading accounted for only a limited proportion of the variation in Ue. Phylogeny was a powerful factor, in combination with wing loading, to account for the variation in Ue. These results demonstrate that functional flight adaptations and constraints associated with different evolutionary lineages have an important influence on cruising flapping flight speed that goes beyond the general aerodynamic scaling effects of mass and wing loading.},

  abstract = {This is the first part of a study on flight characteristics of birds and presents an annotated list of flight speeds of 139 western Palearctic species. All measurements were taken with the same tracking radar and corrected for wind influence according to radar-tracked wind-measuring balloons. Graphical presentation of the birds' air speeds emphasizes the wide variation of speeds within species and allows easy comparison between taxonomic groups, species, and types of flight. Unlike theoretical predictions, speeds increase only slightly with size. The larger species seem to be increasingly limited to speeds close to their speed of minimum power consumption Vmp',. Released birds, apparently reluctant to depart with migratory speed, fly at considerably lower speeds than migrating conspecifics. While large birds seem to be limited to speeds around Vmp', smaller birds seem to be capable of selecting between various speeds, approaching predicted Vmp, when tending to remain airborne at low cost, but flying at much higher speeds when tending to make best progress at low cost (around predicted speed of maximum range Vmr,). Predictions of air speeds by aerodynamic models proved to be too low for small birds because the models do not account for the gain in speed attained by the reduction in profile drag during bounding flight of small passerines. The models predict excessive speeds for large birds because the power output available for flight seems to decline much more with size than previously assumed.},
